This portfolio showcases the work I completed during the ITAI 2276 course, 
highlighting my development as an emerging AI practitioner. Throughout this course,
I enhanced my technical skills, learned to implement AI techniques in
real-world applications,and improved my capacity to document, collaborate,
and present solutions in a professional manner.
My goal with this portfolio is not only to fulfill academic requirements but also to portray myself
as a committed student who is earnest about pursuing a career in Artificial Intelligence. 
This repository acts as a refined display of my competencies in data analysis, machine learning,
model evaluation, and technical communication.
I take pride in delivering work that embodies consistency, clarity, and ongoing improvement 
principles that I will carry into my future studies and professional endeavors.

Course Modules (High-Level Overview)

This section offers a professional overview without explicitly detailing the modules.
Once you provide the official list of modules, I will customize this accordingly.
Throughout ITAI 2276, I navigated a well-structured series of modules that concentrated on:

a. Grasping AI applications and their use cases in the industry
b. Handling data and constructing foundational ML pipelines
c. Assessing and enhancing predictive models
d. Implementing ethical and responsible AI practices
e. Troubleshooting, debugging, and overseeing computational environments

These modules established the foundation for all the projects, exercises,
and reflections included in this portfolio.
Lessons Learned

My primary insights from this course are:

Realistic expectations regarding the iterative process of AI development.
The significance of debugging, version control, and setting up the environment.
Gaining confidence in independently applying machine learning principles.
Understanding how to critically assess model performance.
Enhancing my professional communication skills and organizing technical documentation.
This course has meaningfully challenged me and encouraged my growth — academically, technically, and personally.

🎯 Looking Ahead

I intend to further develop this portfolio with:
1. More sophisticated AI projects.
2. Exploration of deep learning techniques.
3. Examples of end-to-end deployment.
4. Integration with APIs and agent frameworks.
5. Research-oriented case studies.
My ultimate aim is to establish a career in AI that is technically proficient, ethically sound, and impactful.
