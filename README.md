## 📘 Course Module Overview — ITAI 2276: Applied Deep Learning & AI Systems
This course offered a comprehensive exploration of both foundational and advanced concepts in deep learning. Each module progressively built upon the last, leading me from basic neural networks to cutting-edge generative models and AI agents. Below is a detailed overview of all the course modules.

### Module 00: Start Here
This module introduced essential study materials, covering the fundamentals of deep
learning and providing a guide for using Google Colab. It equipped me to work confidently
within cloud-based AI environments.

### Module 01: Welcome & Course Introduction
This module provided a broad introduction to deep learning, outlining course expectations 
and real-world applications. It laid the groundwork for understanding neural networks and
the workflows involved in AI development.

### Module 02: Deep Learning Environments, Libraries & Tools
In this module, I explored the deep learning ecosystem, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, CUDA, NumPy,
and more. I learned how to establish environments and utilize GPUs for efficient model training.

### Module 03: Neural Network Basics
This module addressed fundamental concepts such as perceptrons, activation functions, loss functions, 
and backpropagation. It established the mathematical foundation necessary for all subsequent topics.

### Module 04 — Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This module introduced convolutional layers, pooling techniques, feature extraction methods, and workflows for image classification. The assignments enhanced my grasp of the fundamentals of computer vision.

### Module 05 — Sequence Modeling & NLP (RNNs)

In this section, I explored Recurrent Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs),
and the application of deep learning in processing sequential data. 
This module linked the concepts of neural networks to tasks in natural language processing.

### Module 06 — Transformers & Attention Mechanisms

I examined self-attention mechanisms, encoder-decoder architectures, and the Transformer model,
which serves as the basis for contemporary large language models (LLMs).
I learned the reasons behind the superior performance of Transformers compared to RNNs.

### Module 07 — Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

This module concentrated on learning in latent spaces and the principles of generative modeling.
I discovered how VAEs encode and reconstruct data, as well as how they differ from traditional autoencoders.
### Module 08 — Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

This module covered the training of generators and discriminators, adversarial loss, 
and the tuning of hyperparameters. It enhanced my understanding of how to train generative image models.

### Module 09 — Generative AI with Diffusion Models

In this module, I studied denoising diffusion processes, including DDPMs, DDIMs, 
and classifier-free guidance. I gained valuable insights into the mechanisms 
behind state-of-the-art generative models, such as Stable Diffusion, which produce realistic images.

### Module 10 — Reinforcement Learning & AI Agents

I learned the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, including states, actions, and rewards,
and how these concepts relate to autonomous agents and contemporary AI agent frameworks. 
I also connected classical reinforcement learning with LLM-based agent systems.

### Module 11 — Reasoning Models, RAG & Advanced AI Agents

This module involved an exploration of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), 
the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and advanced architectures for AI agents. 
It established a connection between deep learning and retrieval systems to develop intelligent,
end-to-end AI agents.
